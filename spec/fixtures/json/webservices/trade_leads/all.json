The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to advise industry of this forthcoming requirement and provide industry with general information on the ATB requirement.  There is an immediate need to procure adjustable tow bars to replace the existing rigid A-frame tow bars that do not have the capacity totow the new, heavier Light Armoured Vehicle Upgrade (LAV UP) Family of Vehicles (FOV).  The adjustable functionality will eliminate the need for movement of the recovery vehicle with personnel supporting the tow bar in the crush zone (to permit hook-up of the casualty vehicle), which will reduce the safety risk to personnel during operation.  This RFI is neither a call for tender nor a Request for Proposal (RFP).  No agreement or contract will be entered into based on this RFI.  The issuance of this RFI is not to be considered in any way a commitment by the Government of Canada, nor as authority to potential respondents to undertake any work that could be charged to Canada.  This RFI is not to be considered as a commitment to issue a subsequent solicitation or award contract(s) for the work described herein.  Participation in this RFI is encouraged, but is not mandatory.  There will be no short-listing of potential suppliers for the purposes of undertaking any future work as a result of this RFI. Similarly, participation in this RFI is not a condition or prerequisite for the participation in any potential subsequent solicitation. Respondents will not be reimbursed for any cost incurred by participating in this RFI.  The RFI closing date published herein is not the deadline for comments or input. Comments and input will be accepted any time up to the time when/if a follow-on solicitation is published.   Enquiries:  All enquiries are to be submitted to the Contracting Authority, Jessica Cormier, by telephone (873) 469-4774, facsimile (819-956-0648) or by email at Jessica.Cormier@pwgsc-tpsgc.gc.ca.

      "description": "DLA Energy - Direct Delivery Fuels (FEPDA) intends to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) with contractors, to supply and deliver Diesel, Gasoline, Aviation Jet Fuel, and AVGAS to various locations within Iraq, Jordan, and Turkey. A Basic Ordering Agreement is a written instrument of understanding, which contains the terms and agreements under which future requirements will be solicited, evaluated, awarded and performed. A BOA is not a contract. The parties enter into a binding contract only via the issuance of a delivery order against the BOA based upon the acceptance of the agreement holder's proposal for a specific requirement. Each delivery order will be considered a unique and separate contract or purchase order. The purpose of this BOA is to negotiate in advance any exceptions your company may have to the non-price related terms and conditions contained in this solicitation. Once negotiated, these terms and conditions will be incorporated into any supply contract awarded under the BOA. Companies with BOAs will be able to respond to future solicitations for fuel requirements in Iraq, Jordan, and Turkey. As requirements are received, BOA holders will be given the opportunity to compete based on price and any other criteria as required for performance. Non-BOA holders may compete for orders, which will be publicly posted on FedBizOpps.Gov. However, non-BOA-holders will have to respond to the base Solicitation for entering the BOA, as well as to the solicitations for placement of orders under the BOA. In cases where mission requirements would be jeopardized by holding up award for evaluation of non-price factors of non-BOA holders, DLA Energy will consider whether a BOA can be established with that contractor, and proceed to award the order to a contractor that can meet the Government's requirement. Additionally, as noted on page 2, DLA Energy will consider any contractor for evaluation to become a BOA holder over the five-year period through continually accepting proposals in response to the base Solicitation for this BOA. The period of the BOA is five (5) years from 15 April 2015 to 31 March 2020. The BOA(s) will be reviewed annually to determine if any updates are necessary. BOAs can be terminated by either party with 30 days' written notice. To be eligible for award of a BOA, proposals must provide the following: 1)Signed SF 1449 2)Certifications and Representations (See Section K under Offeror Submission Package (OSP) OR CompletedOfferor Submission Package (OSP) ) 3)A list of any exceptions to the terms and conditions of this solicitation",

      "description": "Background: Transnet, a South African state-owned freight logistics company, recently issued a request for proposals for the design, financing, construction, operation, maintenance and eventual handover of an inland container terminal in Tambo-Springs. The objective of the project is to migrate rail-friendly cargo off the country’s road network. The Tambo-Springs terminal will be located east of Johannesburg, in Ekurhuleni along the N3 motorway, near the Johannesburg-to-Durban rail corridor. The proposed terminal is an integral part of the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Committee’s Strategic Integrated Project 2, which aims to advance the country’s industrial development while boosting export capability. The project is designed to complement Transnet’s five existing inland container-handling terminals in the province. The concession will be for a 20 year period and features the greatest participation from the private sector that Transnet has ever seen. Transnet is seeking a global logistics service provider that can demonstrate technical expertise, maintain a minimum of Level 4 broad-based black economic-empowerment status with a commitment to reach Level 2 by the third year of operation, and abide by the requirements for supplier development and skills transfer.
