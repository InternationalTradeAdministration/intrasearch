      "description": "The Board of Innovation Australia (Board) is an independent statutory board charged with providing advice to government on all innovation, science and research matters. With the passage of legislation by the new parliament, Innovation Australia will change to become Innovation and Science Australia. The Office of Innovation and Science Australia (OISA) has been established within the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (Department) to support the work of the Board. The Board is developing a long term strategic plan to maximise Australia’s innovation potential, positioning Australia to seize the next wave of economic prosperity and ensuring Australia’s wellbeing and economic growth in the future (Plan). To inform the Plan, the Board has commenced a performance audit (Audit) of Australia’s innovation, science and research system (System). The Audit will be delivered to government in December 2016 and will provide baseline data and analysis about the System.Accordingly, the Department invites suitably qualified consultants/contractors, including consortia to submit a tender for consultancy services.",
