  atom: "​The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) The North American Free Trade
    Agreement (NAFTA), negotiated among the United States, Mexico, and Canada, came
    into effect on January 1, 1994. It provided for the elimination of tariffs on most
    goods originating in the three countries over a maximum transition period of 15
    years. For more information on all aspects of NAFTA, please contact your local U.S.
    Commercial Service office. Tariffs will be eliminated only on goods that originate
    in one of the four ways defined in Article 401 of the agreement: Goods wholly obtained
    or produced entirely in the NAFTA region Goods meeting a specific Annex 401 origin
    rule Goods produced entirely in the NAFTA region, exclusively from originating materials
    Unassembled goods and goods whose content does not meet the Annex 401 rule of origin
    but contains NAFTA regional value of 60 percent according to the transaction value
    method or 50 percent according to the net-cost method Article 502 of the NAFTA requires
    that importers base their claims of the country of origin on the exporters’ written
    certificates of origin, which may be the certificate of origin approved by the United
    States (CF 434), the Canadian certificate of origin (Form B-232), or the Mexican
    certificate of origin (Certificado de Origen). The certificate may cover a single
    shipment, or it may be used as a blanket declaration for a period of 12 months.
    In either case, the certificate must be in the importer’s possession when the importer
    is making the claim. See Appendix B for a list of all Free Trade Agreements and
    what is required to take advantage of each."
