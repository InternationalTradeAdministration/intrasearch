  atom: General Information The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was
    enacted in 1994 and created a free trade zone for Mexico, Canada, and the United
    States, is the most important feature in the U.S.-Mexico bilateral commercial relationship.
    As of January 1, 2008, all tariffs and quotas were eliminated on U.S. exports to
    Mexico and Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico
    is the United Statesâ€™ third largest trading partner and second largest export market
    for U.S. products. U.S-Mexico bilateral trade in goods increased from $88 billion
    in 1993, the year prior to the implementation of NAFTA, to $535 billion in 2014,
    an increase of 508 percent, or 9.8 percent per year. The NAFTA provides coverage
    to services with the exception of aviation transport, maritime, and basic telecommunications.
    The agreement also provides intellectual property rights protection in a variety
    of areas including patent, trademark, and copyrighted material. The government procurement
    provisions of the NAFTA apply not only to goods but to contracts for services and
    construction at the federal level. Additionally, U.S. investors are guaranteed equal
    treatment to domestic investors in Mexico and Canada. Additional Information - NAFTA
