  :summary: France’s national firefighting fleet, run by the Sécurité Civile (Civil
    Security) is comprised of 23 aircraft. 12 are Canadair CL 415 which are about 20
    years old, 2 are Canadian Dash 8’s transformed into tankers, 9 are Tracker S2F (U.S.,
    used for aerial patrol missions and to release fire retardant) which will be 58
    years old by the time they are taken out of service between 2018 and 2022. France
    has tested several potential replacements, starting at the small Air Tractor aircraft,
    all the way up to the Beriev Be-200. The Sécurité Civile uses 3 helicopters for
    reconnaissance which are on loan from the Ministry of Defense.
